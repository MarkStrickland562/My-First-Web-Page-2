    <h1>My Cat Sophie</h1>
    <p>I am excited to share with everyone about my favorite cat, Sophie.
         Sophie is 11 years old and is very active. Although most cats don't like
         to swim, my Sophie enjoys it; and she is good at it. Like most cats,
         she has a tendency to be lazy all day despite having a lot of
         potential. I have to reminder her everyday to do things like
         "You should probaby clean yourself." and "Is this where you fur goes?"
         As you can tell, Sophie keeps me busy but I love it.
    </p>
    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Sushi</b></li>
    <p>What cat doesn't like fish? But Sophie brings a new meaning to the
         word LIKE (We'll get to some that later). For now, It is surfice to
         say Sushi is Sophie's favotire food. If I ask her what she want for dinner on Monday, she'd say Sushi. If I
       ask her on Tuesday, you guess it.. She would say Sushi! Sadly, we have
       to limit on letting Sophie decides what's for dinner or we wold be
       having Sushi for dinner every night.
    </p>
    <li><b>Ice Cream</b></li>
    <p>Who can say no to ice cream? Neither can Sophie. Sophie's favorite flavor
       is chocolate brownie.In fact, Sophie liks a lot of things with chocolate
       flavor. chocolate doughnuts, chocolate chips cookies, chocolate.. you
       name it.
    </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>What doesn't Sophie like?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Spice</b></li>
    <p>If you guessed spicy food, you hitting it right on the head. No Sophie
       does not like spicy food. But we are working on her though. She will
       come around eventually.
     </p>
     </ul>
     <p>It turns out I don't actually have a cat. I have a daughter name Sophie
        who is kinda like a cat with plenty of potential and very finicky!</p>
